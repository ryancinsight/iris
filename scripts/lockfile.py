"""Regenerate or check `Cargo.lock` against the source set CI actually resolves.

# The trap this exists for

This repository is normally worked on inside the Atlas stack, whose
`.cargo/config.toml` carries a `[patch]` overlay redirecting every first-party
dependency to a local working tree. Cargo discovers that config by walking up
from the *current directory*, so any `cargo` command run from inside the stack
picks it up -- including anything that rewrites the lock.

A lock written with the overlay active has every `source = "git+..."` line
**stripped**, because those dependencies resolved to local paths rather than to
git. Committing it replaces all 87 git sources with nothing. CI has no overlay,
so it re-resolves, and every `--locked` job fails with

    error: cannot update the lock file ... because --locked was passed

which names neither the cause nor the fix. That message is also what a merely
*stale* lock produces -- one pinning first-party revisions whose versions no
longer satisfy the manifests -- so the two failures are indistinguishable from
the log alone (KW-CI-087).

This is not limited to deliberate regeneration. *Any* cargo invocation that
updates the lock while the overlay is active flattens it -- an ordinary
`cargo check` inside the stack is enough, which is how it happens in practice:
nobody sets out to rewrite the lock. Treat a modified `Cargo.lock` after routine
work as suspect and run `--check` before staging it.

Both are fixed the same way: regenerate from outside the overlay. This script
does that by running cargo from a temporary directory that is not underneath the
stack root, which is the whole mechanism -- there is no flag that disables config
discovery.

# Usage

    scripts/lockfile.py --check        # verify the committed lock, offline
    scripts/lockfile.py --regenerate   # rewrite it correctly (needs network)

    `manifest` defaults to `MANIFEST` as it stands at call time -- `main`
